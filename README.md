# Password Generating Function

## Description

### **This repository includes javascript functions that generate a randomized password based on user selected criteria**

### Developing the main function

The main portion of my contribution of the code is creating a function that can take user prompts and develop a password accordingly. My biggest motivation for this was to develop my skills with functions in general and different methods that can be applied to arrays.  

More specifically, my function firsts takes a desired length for the password from the user. From there, a series of prompts will confirm what criteria must be met for the generated password. Then, I initialized arrays that hold all possible characters, and generated a new array to hold only the characters that the user expects. To finish, the code it's as simple as randomly selecting characters from the new array and concatenating those characters until a password of desired length is created.

One major roadblock I faced were properly indexing the correct array, and I quickly found that better naming conventions for arrays truly makes a difference in efficiency.
